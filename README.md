# imagen

The [imagen](imagen) directory contains 1,000 JPEG images sampled from [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/), five for each of [200 categories](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2017/browse-det-synsets). Each filename begins with the image's ImageNet ID, which itself starts with a WordNet ID. Filenames also include a simple English text label for convenience. The collection comes to about 103 megabytes. For more on how this was produced, see [Sampling ImageNet](http://planspace.org/20170430-sampling_imagenet/).

This is intended to be helpful for demonstration purposes. This collection does not make or alter any copyright claims. Please contact me with any issues.
